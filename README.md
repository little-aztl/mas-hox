# mini-hok

- mini-hok: a novel MARL benchmark based on the popular mobile game, Honor of Kings, to address limitations in existing environments such as complexity and accessibility. 
- The environment simulates engagements between multiple heroes battling against the Dark Dragon, boasting heightened computational efficiency. Adopting the Dark Dragon's remaining health at the end of the game as the evaluation metric, discernible distinctions in the performance of different algorithms can be achieved
- We offer a game editor, allowing researchers to tailor heroes, levels, equipment and so on, thereby fostering more diverse scenarios.
